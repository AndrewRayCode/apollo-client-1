# LWC RAD Utilities

This is an experimental, opinionated UI library, for rapidly prototyping LWC applications using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).  

Eventually, it will be published as a standalone package.  

As of today, it can change any time to apply the best LWC patterns, so use it at your own risks.  

Stay tuned!
